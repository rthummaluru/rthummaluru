# Welcome to my Page!
I'm someone passionate about solving real world problems with the use of AI and new upcoming technology!

### What I'm Currently Working On
**Threadweaver** – An AI agent that connects the dots across your digital workspace (Notion, Slack, GitHub, Google Docs) using LangGraph agents + vector memory. Essentially an assistant that can help provide information or take actions given the context of you're entire ecosystem!

### What I’m Exploring 🔍
- Memory & tool-use in AI agents
- Open-source LLM orchestration (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- Self-hosted vector stores + LLM APIs
- Google AI
