# 👋 Hey, I'm [Your Name]

I'm an **AI Full Stack Engineer** building intelligent, real-world applications powered by LLMs, LangChain, and modern full stack technologies. My passion lies in crafting end-to-end tools that connect user experience with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

### 💡 What I’m Working On
- 🧠 **Threadweaver** – An AI assistant that connects the dots across your digital workspace (Notion, Slack, GitHub, Google Docs) using LangChain agents + vector memory.
- 📓 **AI Journal App** – A lightweight journaling app that turns your entries into insights using LLMs and embeddings.
- 🧰 Exploring self-hosted LLM tools and orchestration frameworks like OpenDevin and CrewAI.

### 🧠 Core Stack
`LangChain` • `OpenAI API` • `FastAPI` • `Pinecone` • `React + Tailwind` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `Supabase` • `LLM Agents` • `RAG`

### 🔍 What I’m Exploring
- Memory & tool-use in AI agents
- Open-source LLM orchestration (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- Self-hosted vector stores + LLM APIs
